      title: "Classic Fluffy Pancakes",
      description: "The ultimate weekend breakfast. These pancakes are light, fluffy, and perfect for soaking up maple syrup.",
      steps: [
        "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and sugar. Create a well in the center.",
        "In a separate jug, whisk the eggs, milk, and melted butter until combined.",
        "Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently with a fork until just combined - do not overmix! It is okay if there are some lumps.",
        "Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat. Grease lightly with a little extra butter or oil.",
        "Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the pan.",
        "Cook until bubbles appear on the surface and pop (about 2-3 minutes).",
        "Flip carefully and cook the other side until golden brown (another 1-2 minutes). Serve hot!"

    spaghetti_aglio: {
      title: "Spaghetti Aglio e Olio",
      description: "A traditional Italian pasta dish from Naples. It's incredibly simple but relies on technique to create a creamy emulsion.",
      steps: [
        "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook until 'al dente' (usually 1 minute less than package instructions).",
        "While pasta cooks, peel and thinly slice the garlic cloves.",
        "In a large cold pan, combine the olive oil and garlic. Turn heat to medium-low and cook slowly. You want the garlic to turn pale gold, not brown or burnt.",
        "Once the garlic is golden, add the chili flakes. Carefully ladle in about 1 cup of the starchy pasta water to stop the frying process (watch out for steam!).",
        "Drain the pasta and toss it directly into the pan. Increase heat to high.",
        "Stir and toss vigorously for 1-2 minutes. The oil and water will emulsify into a creamy, glossy sauce that coats the noodles. Garnish with parsley/herbs if available."

    scrambled_eggs: {
      title: "Perfect Creamy Scrambled Eggs",
      description: "Forget rubbery eggs. This method yields rich, custard-like soft scrambled eggs.",
      steps: [
        "Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add the salt and pepper. Whisk vigorously until the mixture is uniform and airy.",
        "Place a non-stick pan over medium-low heat and add the butter.",
        "Once the butter foams, pour in the eggs. Do not walk away!",
        "Using a spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges to the center, creating soft curds. Tilt the pan to let uncooked egg flow to the hot spots.",
        "When the eggs are mostly set but still look slightly wet/shiny, remove the pan from the heat immediately. The residual heat will finish cooking them.",
        "Serve immediately on toast or plates."

        "Place one slice of bread in the pan, butter-side down.",
        "Top with the cheese slices. Place the second slice of bread on top, butter-side up.",
        "Cook for 3-4 minutes until the bottom is deep golden brown and crispy.",
        "Flip carefully. Cook the other side for another 2-3 minutes until golden and the cheese is fully melted.",
        "Slice diagonally and serve hot."

        "In a bowl, whisk the eggs, grated parmesan, and a generous amount of black pepper into a thick paste.",
        "Cook pasta until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain.",
        "Add the hot pasta directly to the pan with the bacon fat. Toss well to coat.",
        "IMPORTANT: Remove pan from heat entirely. Pour in the egg mixture and a splash of pasta water. Stir quickly and continuously to create a creamy sauce without scrambling the eggs.",
        "Serve immediately with extra cheese and pepper."
